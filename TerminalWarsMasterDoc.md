# TerminalWars MasterDoc

### Summary
TerminalWars is an attempt to create a multiplayer D&D-like experience, that can be used for less serious, comedic campaigns, as well as serious, fleshed out ones. While the experience of a text adventure is retained, players can also have images next to their name. They're also able to create minigames, and make people play them as part of their attack. While you have to use your imagination, you can also express your character visually too.

### Gameplay
Battles work in a turn based system. When a player's turn arrives, they can do any of the following:
- Choose one of their "actives" from a dropdown (explained below)
- Do a very basic attack (unless their bio says they don't have one). To do their basic attack, a player types the command
`/basic <target> <flair>`, i.e. `/basic ioi "throws a rock at {target} and makes him trip"`. `{target}` is replaced with the target name, which is useful because the target can be `{random}`. 
- They can also do an "inspect" active on a player to see their bio and health. 
- Open their bag. They can double click an item in that bag to use it, or they can do `/give <target> <item>`, and they can drag an item from their bag into the window to autofill the name in the input dialog.
- Switch to a different character; a player can own multiple.
- Send messages to anyone on the battlefield. This can be done outside of battle too. People should be able to type in italics by surrounding their text with *.

Actives are custom attacks that are created by the player's owner. The dungeon master can enable a points system for attacks, requiring players to balance their attacks by spending points on certain commands. This is optional, but it's game wide; either all players use points, or none of them.

Characters also have passives, which work exactly like actives, but are generally not selectable, and are automatically activated at the start of a battle. This is useful for abilities, and also status effects - people have ~~apparently~~ made bios entirely around passives. Changes made by passives are usually always active, but a player can remove their own passive.

Finally, a character may have "specials", which are actives that are reusable by certain attacks. 

A battle may have two modes: a "free for all" in which anyone can attack with max accuracy, or a "dice" mode in which both players have a random chance of missing their attacks. This is game-specific, a player with max accuracy can't go against a dice player. Max accuracy players also have set defense, and that defense is subtracted from each attack.

Turn order should be chosen by a dice roll between all players or teams, but if it's a one on one battle, we specifically due a coin flip. It can also be determined by a minigame, if a player has a passive that calls for it.
