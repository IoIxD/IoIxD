# [My website gives a better bio then I ever could](https://ioi-xd.net)

But if you don't want to click that, you should I know that I'm experienced in (from most experienced to least):

- Golang
- HTML/CSS (by hand, no frameworks or anything)
- Javascript
  - Node.js to an extent; I know ES6 stuff but I've only briefly done a small server with it.
