# [My website gives a better bio then I ever could](https://ioi-xd.net)

But if you don't want to click that, you should I know that I'm experienced in (from most experienced to least):

- Golang
- HTML/CSS (by hand, no frameworks or anything)
- Javascript
  - Node.js to an extent; I know ES6 stuff but I've only briefly done a small server with it.
- I can write and comprehend Python code but I have minimal experience with it and am generally not a fan of it.

**You should also know that I've made the following!**
- [@glitchfuck1](https://twitter.com/glitchfuck1), a Twitter bot that posts glitch imagery every two hours, by xor'ing two generated images together. 
  - The code for this is not publically avaliable because of the potential misuse from the NFT community. Sorry.
